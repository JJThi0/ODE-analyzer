# ODE-analyzer
A series of Python classes that can be used to analyse (systems of) first order and seconder order ordinary differential equations.

This was orignally written as a practical for my university course. It has since grown into a small library that I use for analyzing (systems of) ODEs. Particularly useful for the Schroedinger equation.
